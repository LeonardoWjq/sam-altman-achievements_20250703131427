        <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
        <p>Born in Chicago and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Sam Altman demonstrated an early interest in computers, learning to code at the young age of eight. This early passion for technology would shape his future career path and contributions to the tech industry.</p>
        <p>Altman attended John Burroughs School in St. Louis before enrolling at Stanford University to study computer science. However, his entrepreneurial spirit led him to drop out after just two years in 2005 to co-found Loopt, a location-sharing mobile application. This early venture proved successful, and Loopt was eventually acquired for $43 million in 2012, marking the beginning of Altman's impressive career in technology and entrepreneurship.</p>
